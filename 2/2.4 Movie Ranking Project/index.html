<h1>The Best Animes according to Sambhav</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Naruto (+Shippuden)</h3>
<p>This is a must watch fantasy anime, it is on longer side but it has great story and villans.</p>
<h3>Eminence in Shadow</h3>
<p>Its a Isekai... May be thats not enough ... Its a cliche filled hilarious Isekai.</p>
<h3>Classroom of the Elite</h3>
<p>This is also a very good psycological anf school genre anime.</p>
